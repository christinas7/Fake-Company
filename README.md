Hello. Thank you for taking the time to view my work. I am in the process of setting up a fake distribution company in order to practice SQL and data visualization. The data is what one would find/use in Human Resources Operations organization (as that is my background) but will eventually include other data such as sales and financial data. I have broken the work in to phases, with each phase adding a new layer of information and visualization.

To complete this work I am utilizing Excel, MySQL and Tableau. All the data is FAKE. 70% of the data was created by me with the remaing 30% from open source datasets from Kaggle, data.gov and BrianDunning.com (data retreived from data.gov, such as addresses, has been updated to fake locations). Not all the data will have an attached visualization but each one will provide an extract of the code used in MySQL for creating/updating databases, tables and values and the code I used for extracting the required data. 

This project has been a labor of love for me as I transition from an HR Business Analyst to an HR Data Analyst. 

Thank you for your time.
